    <h2>Sumner Brandt</h2>
    <p>My name is Sumner Brandt</p>
    <p>I'm 19 years old. Currently I'm majoring in computer science though that may change. </p>
    <p>I like to cook and bake. I also love the outdoors and I really enjoy going on walks and geocaching. </p>
    <p>If I could I would major in philosophy, however it's not a particulary useful degree, I just find it very intertesting.</p>
    <p>I play the cello and I love all kinds of music. I've been listening to a lot of movie OST's recently. The Edward Scissorhands OST is something I found recently that has some really cool music to listen to. Some of my favorite musicals are Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton.</p>
